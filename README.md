## Exploring Graph Data Models for Timetabling Insights
### A proof-of-concept data engineering project

Final Project in support of a Masters in Data Science at [UWE Bristol](www.uwe.ac.uk)

## Overview

This repository contains the final dissertation project for a Master's degree in Data Science. The primary aim of this project is to investigate the viability of using graph data structures for enhanced timetabling analytics and reporting.

**Objectives include:**

1. Designing an **extensible, system-agnostic graph data model** for university timetables
2. Developing a **configurable ETL** (extract, transform, load) pipeline to transition from relational to graph database representations of timetables
3. Discussing how **graph-based approaches to timetabling analysis** could contribute to measuring and improving timetable quality.

## How to View the Project
