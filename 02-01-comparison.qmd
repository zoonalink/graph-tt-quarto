As outlined in the [project aims](01-04-project.qmd), my hypothesis is that graph-based approaches have the *potential* to offer new insights and efficiencies in timetable analysis. This section will briefly explore the theoretical underpinnings of graph data structures and their application to domain of university timetabling.


## Relational Models
### Tables, Joins and the Limits of Interconnectedness

Relational databases, using SQL as their query language, have long been the go-to for managing data, including timetabling information. They structure data into tables, where rows represent instances of entities (e.g. individual rooms, staff, or students) and columns represent their attributes (name, capacity, email, etc.). Relationships between these entity tables are established through foreign keys, forming links between tables. This often involves intermediary "relationship" tables to handle the many-to-many nature of timetabling data (e.g., a student attends many activities, and an activity has many students) (Khan et al., 2023;Sokolova, GÃ³mez and Borisoglebskaya, 2020).

While robust and well-understood, relational databases start to show their limitations when dealing with the highly interconnected nature of timetables:

-   **Join Complexity**: Even seemingly simple queries, like *"find students attending a specific lecturer's class in a particular building,"* require joining multiple tables (see below in both SQL and graph queries). As queries become more nuanced, the number of joins increases, often impacting performance, especially with large datasets.

-   **Rigidity**: Relational databases rely on a predefined schema, making them less adaptable to evolving needs. Adding new entities or relationships is not possible without disrupting existing queries and applications.

**Example Query in SQL**
```{sql}
-- Assuming "BuildingName" is in V_BUILDING and linked to V_LOCATION
-- find students attending a specific lecturer's class in a particular building
-- requires 6 JOINS


SELECT DISTINCT 
    ss.[FirstName], 
    ss.[LastName],
    ss.[Email]
FROM [RDB_MAIN2223].[rdowner].[V_STUDENTSET] ss
INNER JOIN [RDB_MAIN2223].[rdowner].[V_ACTIVITY_STUDENTSET] acts ON ss.[Id] = acts.[StudentSetId]
INNER JOIN [RDB_MAIN2223].[rdowner].[V_ACTIVITY] a ON acts.[ActivityId] = a.[Id]
INNER JOIN [RDB_MAIN2223].[rdowner].[V_ACTIVITY_LOCATION] al ON a.[Id] = al.[ActivityId]
INNER JOIN [RDB_MAIN2223].[rdowner].[V_LOCATION] l ON al.[LocationId] = l.[Id]
INNER JOIN [RDB_MAIN2223].[rdowner].[V_BUILDING] b ON l.[BuildingId] = b.[Id] 
INNER JOIN [RDB_MAIN2223].[rdowner].[V_ACTIVITY_STAFF] ast ON a.[Id] = ast.[ActivityId]
WHERE ast.[StaffId] = 'StaffID'  
  AND b.[Name] = 'BuildingName'; 
```

## Graph Models
### Embracing interconnectedness

In contrast to the rigid table structure of relational databases, graph databases offer a more intuitive and flexible approach for representing interconnected data like timetables. They utilise:

-   **Nodes**: Represent entities (e.g., activity, room, staff, student).  These are often "nouns."
-   **Edges**: Represent relationships between nodes (e.g., "taught by," "enrolled in," "scheduled at").  These are often "verbs."

This node-and-edge structure inherently reflects how timetabling elements connect. Instead of relying on cumbersome joins, relationships are directly encoded in the data model itself. This results in several advantages:

-   **Natural Representation**: Graph databases visually and conceptually mirror the relationships inherent in timetables, making them easier to understand and query.
-   **Relationship-Centric Queries**: Graph databases are optimised for traversing and analysing relationships. Queries that would require multiple joins in a relational database often become significantly simpler and faster in a graph database - see below.
-   **Flexibility**: The schema-less or schema-optional nature of most graph databases allows for greater flexibility in data modeling. New entities or relationships can be added effortlessly without impacting existing structures or queries (Nan and Bai, 2019; Webber, Eifrem and Robinson, 2013).

**Example Query in Cypher**
```{cypher}
// Assuming properties on nodes
// Much simpler query pattern

MATCH (s:Student)-[:ATTENDS]->(a:Activity)<-[:TEACHES_ON]-(st:Staff), 
      (a:Activity)-[:TAKES_PLACE_IN]->(r:Room)
WHERE st.last_name = "LecturerLastName" AND r.building = "BuildingName"
RETURN s.first_name, s.last_name, s.email 
```
