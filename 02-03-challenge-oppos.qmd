## Opportunities

1. Unlocking Hidden Patterns:
* Example: "By analyzing student enrollment patterns in relation to course times and locations, we might uncover commuting difficulties that impact attendance, informing future scheduling."
* General Point: Graphs excel at revealing patterns across relationships, not just within isolated data points.
2. Stakeholder-Centric Analysis:
* Example: "We can query the graph to assess how well a timetable meets faculty preferences for teaching times while also considering student travel burdens, revealing potential areas for improvement."
* General Point: Graphs can model multiple perspectives simultaneously, unlike traditional approaches that often focus on one optimization goal at a time.
3. What-If Scenarios and Simulations:
* Example: "Adding hypothetical courses or adjusting room capacities in the graph allows us to simulate the impact on existing timetables before implementation, aiding decision-making."
* General Point: Graphs' flexibility makes them well-suited for modeling change, not just representing static data.
4. Visual Exploration and Communication:
* Example: "Presenting graph visualizations to stakeholders (even non-technical ones) can foster shared understanding of timetable complexities and potential trade-offs, leading to better buy-in."
* General Point: While not unique to graphs, they lend themselves well to visual tools, which can be powerful for communication beyond raw numbers.

## Challenges
1. Data Migration and Integration:
* Point: Moving from an existing relational system to a graph database requires careful planning and potential data transformation. This can be a significant upfront effort, especially for large universities.
2. Tooling and Expertise:
* Point: While maturing, the graph database ecosystem might have a steeper learning curve than traditional SQL-based tools. Finding staff with the right expertise could be a consideration.
3. Performance at Scale:
* Point: While generally efficient, graph database performance depends on query complexity and dataset size. For extremely large universities, careful optimization and potentially specialized graph database solutions might be needed.
4. "Soft" Constraint Modeling:
* Point: While graphs excel at representing relationships, quantifying subjective preferences (e.g., how much a student dislikes a late evening class) can still be challenging and might require combining graph analysis with other techniques.
