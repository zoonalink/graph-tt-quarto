title: Aim and Scope of Project
---


The primary aim of this project is to investigate the viability of using graph data structures for enhanced timetabling analytics and reporting.


## Scope

This project will focus on:

* Developing a graph-based data model for university timetables
* Building a configurable, extensible data-engineering solution to move data from relational database to graph database
* Implementing a prototype, proof-of-concept system for timetable analysis using graph databases
* Discuss future development opportunities

The project will **not** include:

* Implementation of a full-scale timetabling system
* Real-time timetable genation or optimisation

## Objectives

The key objectives of this project are:

* Design an extensible, system-agnostic graph data model for university timetables
* Develop a mapping pipeline to transition from relational to graph database representations of timetables
* Implement and evaluate a set of proof-of-concept analytical metrics leveraging the graph data model
* Discuss the performance and capabilities of graph-based analytics against traditional relational database approaches
* Discuss how graph-based approaches might contribute to measuring and improving timetable 'quality' from various stakeholder perspectives.

Through these objectives, I aim to explore the potential of graph-based approaches in enhancing our understanding and analysis of university timetables, potentially opening new avenues for timetable quality assessment. This work aligns with the growing recognition of timetabling as a critical factor in institutional sustainability, student satisfaction, and overall university operations.
