    "1. Match and Sort Activities:\n",

    "* WITH s, a ORDER BY a.actStartDate, a.actStartTime: Sorts the activities by their start date and then by their start time within each date.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate Total Hours and Group Activities into Blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* WITH s, a.actStartDate AS Date, SUM(a.actDurationInMinutes) / 60.0 AS totalHours, ...: Calculates the total hours spent on activities for each date by summing the durations of all activities on that date and converting minutes to hours.\n",
    "* REDUCE(blockInfo = [], activity IN COLLECT(a) | ...): Groups activities into blocks based on time overlaps using a REDUCE function and a CASE expression.\n",
    "  * It initialises an empty list blockInfo to store the blocks.\n",
    "  * It iterates over the collected activities (COLLECT(a)).\n",
    "  * For each activity:\n",
    "    * If blockInfo is empty (first activity), it creates a new block with the activity.\n",
    "    * Otherwise, it checks if the current activity overlaps with the last activity in the last block of blockInfo.\n",
    "      * If there's an overlap, it adds the current activity to the last block.\n",
    "      * If there's no overlap, it creates a new block with the current activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate Block Hours and Number of Activities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* UNWIND blocks AS block: Unwinds the list of blocks, processing each block individually.\n",
    "* WITH s, Date, totalHours, blocks, REDUCE(blockHours = 0.0, activity IN block | blockHours + activity.actDurationInMinutes) / 60.0 AS blockHours, SIZE(block) AS blockActivities: For each block, it calculates the total duration in hours (blockHours) by summing the durations of activities within the block and converting minutes to hours. It also calculates the number of activities in the block (blockActivities).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Return Aggregated Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "* RETURN s.stuFullName_anon AS Student, Date, totalHours, MAX(blockHours) AS blockHours, MAX(blockActivities) AS blockActivities ORDER BY Date;: Returns the student's full name, the date, the total hours for the day, the maximum block hours across all blocks for that day, and the maximum number of activities within a single block for that day. The results are ordered by date."
