University timetabling is the complex process of scheduling courses, rooms, and resources within an academic institution. At its simplest, it involves collecting and combining time slots, rooms, students and other resources while satisfying a multitude of constraints and preferences to achieve a *viable* outcome.


## What is University Timetabling? 

But it is never as simple as that...

University timetabling is a critical administrative task that involves creating a learning and teaching schedule for students and staff, respectively.  It is undertaken by *schedulers* who are multi-skilled professionals needing to incorporate various skills including data analysis, change management, negotiating, complaint management and optimisation.  (Dowland, 2018)

Timetabling complexity can vary from *simple* room bookings on one end of the scale to bespoke, individual schedules.  Institutional goals can range from maximising room utilisation to delivering a great student experience.  More often than not, university will attempt to deliver **everything** and only realise a fraction of the objectives.  There are several reasons for this and they will vary with each institution, but fundamentally, certain objectives are contradictory - if you maximise room utilisation, experience is likely to worsen.  The other major reason is that there is no such thing as a *universally* good timetable - what is good for one student will almost certainly not be good for another.  

So timetabling and timetablers always find themselves in the firing line of criticism - they cannot win and the old adage 'no news is good news' could not be truer. 

## Why is University Timetabling Challenging?

The complexity of university timetabling stems from several factors:

**Scale**: Universities often have tens of thousands of students, hundreds of programmes (courses), thousands of modules, and limited resources.
**Constraints**: There are numerous hard constraints (e.g., room capacity) and soft constraints (e.g., preferences) to consider.
**Interdependencies**: Changes in one part of the schedule have cascading effects on other parts.
**Diversity of Needs**: Different organisational units (colleges, faculties, schools, departments) have varying requirements and preferences.
**Optimisation Goals**: Balancing efficiency, fairness, and quality of education.

## Operational Challenges

Some of the keyy operational challenges in university timetabling include:

* **Resource Utilisation**: Maximising the use of available rooms and equipment.
* **Conflict Resolution**: Avoiding scheduling conflicts for students and staff.
* **Adaptability**: Accommodating last-minute changes or unforeseen circumstances.
* **Equity**: Ensuring fair distribution of desirable time slots and resources.
* **Data Quality and Interoperability**: Ensuring clean, accurate data flows between interconnected systems.
* **Curriculum Complexity**: Managing the intricacies of programme deliveries including excluded combinations, elective choices.
* **Balancing Flexibility and Structure**: Accommodating diverse teaching styles while maintaining a consistent schedule.
* **Stakeholder Communication**: Effectively conveying timetable information and changes to all parties involved.


## The Elusive "Good Timetable"

Despite best efforts, it's impossible to find universal satisfaction with a university timetable. What constitutes a "good" timetable is often subjective and can vary among stakeholders. 

Based on surveys across various institutions, students typically prioritise (Dowland, 2018) (Norman, 2022):

* A clash-free timetable
* Early release of timetables
* Clear and accurate information
* Full-year timetable availability
* Minimal changes after publication
* Effective communication of any changes
* Balanced distribution of classes (e.g., no single-hour events on a day, some free days, consecutive hours)

Meanwhile, other stakeholders have different priorities:

* Individual students may prefer learning times that align with their personal commitments such as part-time employment or travel arrangements. 
* Individual academic staff may prefer teaching times that align with their research or personal commitments.
* Administrators might focus on efficient resource utilisation and institutional sustainability.
* Departments may have specific needs for specialised rooms or equipment such as laboratories, etc.

This divergence in preferences and the complex interplay of constraints make it challenging to define and achieve a universally "good" timetable, setting the stage for ongoing research and improvement in this field.  In the private sector, there are companies which will offer analysis and solutions to address some challenges but these are often blunt and focus on efficiencies (e.g. utilisation) as opposed to pedagogical and experience motivation.

University timetabling is a complex, multifaceted problem that has been the subject of extensive research and practical implementations for decades. At its core, timetabling involves the allocation of limited resources, such as rooms, lecturers, and time slots, to a set of events or activities, such as lectures, tutorials, and examinations. The goal is to create a timetable that satisfies a multitude of constraints and objectives, ranging from avoiding scheduling conflicts and ensuring equitable resource distribution to delivering excellent pedagogy,  accommodating student preferences and optimising space utilisation.

The challenges inherent in university timetabling stem from the intricate interplay of numerous factors. The availability of resources is often constrained, with limited classrooms and instructors needing to be shared across a wide array of courses and programs. Student enrollment patterns and preferences introduce additional complexity, as timetables must cater to diverse needs and avoid scheduling conflicts for individual students. Furthermore, institutional constraints, such as departmental requirements, accreditation standards, and regulatory frameworks, impose additional restrictions on the timetabling process.

To address these challenges, researchers and practitioners have developed a variety of approaches and algorithms for university timetabling. These approaches often involve optimisation techniques, such as integer programming, constraint programming, and metaheuristics, to find feasible and efficient solutions. However, the real-world complexities of university timetabling often necessitate compromises and trade-offs, as it is rarely possible to satisfy all constraints and objectives simultaneously.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in exploring novel approaches to university timetabling, leveraging advancements in data science, machine learning, and graph theory. These approaches aim to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and adaptability of timetabling processes, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for students, instructors, and institutions.

1.1 Project Context and Motivation
This project is motivated by the recognition that traditional timetabling approaches, while valuable, may not fully capture the nuances and complexities of the modern university environment. In particular, the increasing emphasis on student-centered learning and the need to provide a positive student experience have highlighted the limitations of conventional timetabling methods.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that the relational database structures commonly employed in timetabling systems may hinder the ability to effectively measure and report on the "quality" of a timetable. This limitation can impede efforts to understand the impact of timetables on student experiences and to make data-driven improvements.

Given the highly relational nature of timetables, where courses, instructors, rooms, and time slots are interconnected in intricate ways, it is hypothesized that a graph-based approach could offer a more natural and insightful way to represent and analyze timetable data. Graph databases, designed to handle complex relationships and interconnected data, have the potential to unlock new avenues for understanding and optimizing university timetables.

1.2 Aim and Scope
This project aims to investigate the viability of using graph data structures for university timetables and to explore the potential for enhanced reporting capabilities, including the establishment of measures of "timetable quality." The project will focus on the following key areas:

Foundational Research: The project will contribute to the foundational research in the field of graph-based timetabling analytics, exploring new ways to leverage graph data structures to gain deeper insights into timetabling data.
Proof-of-Concept Analytics: A focused graph-based timetabling prototype will be developed to address specific analytical use cases relevant to university timetabling. This prototype will demonstrate the potential of graph-based analytics to go beyond traditional scheduling and optimization benchmarks.
Comparative Evaluation: A comparative assessment between graph and relational databases will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of graph approaches for focused analytical tasks. This evaluation will highlight the potential advantages of graph-based methods over traditional relational approaches.
Metrics for Timetable Quality: The project will develop and expand metrics to measure timetable "quality," moving beyond conventional scheduling and optimization benchmarks. These metrics will enable robust comparisons of different timetable instances or versions, taking into account factors that contribute to a positive student experience.
By addressing these key areas, this project aims to lay the groundwork for a new paradigm in university timetabling, one that leverages the power of graph data structures to enhance reporting capabilities, improve decision-making, and ultimately create timetables that better serve the needs of students, instructors, and institutions.
