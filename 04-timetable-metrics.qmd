title: "Timetable Metrics" 
---

* intro / segue into timetable metrics.
* link to cypher queries for basic analysis, basic understanding
* but to understand quality and measurable quality, we need to be able to define what we mean
* my idea is to develop a timetable metric, index which is quantifiable and measurable and comparable 
* but also flexible and adaptable to organisational needs and priorities - it is tweakable
* describe general idea of penalties and positivies to get a score - details are to be determined
* but the general concept is that every student (or staff, or programme) - timetabling object can have a quality score/measure
* for simplicity, we can imagine starting with a score of 100 - which is either neutral.  the score can increase (with positive metrics) and decrease when penalised.  
* mentions hard and soft constraints before - these are examples of what would be used to calculate the score
* everyone has a lunch break is either rewarded or not penalised
* no clashes is the minimum, so a clash should be a penalty
* long days are a penalty etc.
* can add other datasets like room locations to calculate distances and travel time (see cypher page)

## Timetable Quality Metrics and Insights

### 4.1 Defining Timetable Quality

### 4.2 Implemented Metrics
* Constraint violations (max hours per day, days per week, lunch breaks, etc.)
* Distance-based metrics using room properties

### 4.3 Aggregation Methods
* Student-level, programme-level, and other relevant groupings

### 4.4 Cypher Queries for Metric Calculation
* Example queries with explanations

### 4.5 Visualization of Results
* Bloom visualisations or other relevant charts
