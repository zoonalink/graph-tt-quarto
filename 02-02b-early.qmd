## Unveiling Basic Patterns

Even with this basic model, we can easily extract valuable insights, for example:

-   **Activity Load**: Identify staff with the highest number of teaching activities or total teaching hours.
-   **Student Timetable Profiles**: Calculate average hours per student or per programme to understand workload distribution.
-   **Resource utilisation**: Determine the busiest teaching locations or times on campus.
-   **Anomaly detection**: Identify students who have unexpected profiles or unusual combinations.

### Example code

**Busiest location overall**

```{cypher .cypher-scroll}
MATCH (r:Room)<-[:TAKES_PLACE_IN]-(a:Activity)
WITH r, sum(a.duration) AS totalDuration
RETURN r.name AS Room, totalDuration
ORDER BY totalDuration DESC
LIMIT 1
```

**Busiest location for a specific time**

```{cypher .cypher-scroll}
MATCH (r:Room)<-[:TAKES_PLACE_IN]-(a:Activity)
WHERE a.startTime = "11:00" 
WITH r, count(a) AS activityCount
RETURN r.name AS Room, activityCount
ORDER BY activityCount DESC
LIMIT 1 
```

**Students with below/above average hours**

```{cypher .cypher-scroll}
// Calculate program averages and standard deviations
MATCH (s:Student)-[:IS_ALLOCATED_TO]->(a:Activity)
WITH s.prog AS programme, AVG(a.duration) AS avgDuration, STDEV(a.duration) AS stdDev
GROUP BY programme

// Identify students outside the 10% margin 
MATCH (s:Student)-[:IS_ALLOCATED_TO]->(a:Activity)
WITH s.studentID AS studentID, s.prog AS program, SUM(a.duration) AS totalDuration
MATCH (avgData)
WHERE avgData.programme = programme
WITH studentID, programme, totalDuration, avgData.avgDuration AS avgDuration, avgData.stdDev AS stdDev
WHERE totalDuration < avgDuration - (0.1 * avgDuration) OR totalDuration > avgDuration + (0.1 * avgDuration)
RETURN studentID, programme, totalDuration, avgDuration, stdDev 
ORDER BY programme, totalDuration DESC
```
