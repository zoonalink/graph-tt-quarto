Scenarios for Demonstrating Neo4j Explore Functionality with Perspectives and Scenes

Scenario 1: Programme Lead Perspective

Goal: Enable a programme lead to gain insights into their program's structure, student engagement, and potential areas for improvement.

Perspective:

Nodes:

Programme (central node)
Module
Student
Activity
Room
Staff
Relationships:

Programme -[:HAS_MODULE]-> Module
Module -[:HAS_ACTIVITY]-> Activity
Student -[:ENROLLED_IN]-> Programme
Student -[:ATTENDS]-> Activity
Activity -[:TAKES_PLACE_IN]-> Room
Staff -[:TEACHES]-> Activity
Scenes:

Programme Overview: Visualize the entire programme structure, showcasing modules, their connections, and associated activities. Highlight popular and less popular modules based on student enrollment.
Student Engagement: Focus on a specific module and visualize student attendance patterns. Identify students with low attendance and potential at-risk students.
Resource Allocation: Visualize room utilization across the programme's activities. Identify potential scheduling conflicts or underutilized spaces.
Staff Workload: Analyze the distribution of teaching workload among staff members within the programme.
Cypher Queries:

Programme Structure:
Cypher
MATCH (p:Programme {name: 'Computer Science'})-[:HAS_MODULE]->(m:Module)
RETURN p, m
Use code with caution.

Student Attendance:
Cypher
MATCH (m:Module {name: 'Data Structures'})<-[:HAS_MODULE]-(p:Programme)<-[:ENROLLED_IN]-(s:Student)-[:ATTENDS]->(a:Activity)
RETURN m, s, a
Use code with caution.

Room Utilization:
Cypher
MATCH (p:Programme)<-[:HAS_MODULE]-(m:Module)-[:HAS_ACTIVITY]->(a:Activity)-[:TAKES_PLACE_IN]->(r:Room)
RETURN p, m, a, r
Use code with caution.

Staff Workload:
Cypher
MATCH (p:Programme)<-[:HAS_MODULE]-(m:Module)-[:HAS_ACTIVITY]->(a:Activity)<-[:TEACHES]-(s:Staff)
RETURN p, m, a, s
Use code with caution.

Scenario 2: Module Lead Perspective

Goal: Provide a module lead with insights into their module's scheduling, student performance, and room allocation.

Perspective:

Nodes:

Module (central node)
Activity
Student
Room
Assessment
Relationships:

Module -[:HAS_ACTIVITY]-> Activity
Student -[:ATTENDS]-> Activity
Activity -[:TAKES_PLACE_IN]-> Room
Student -[:HAS_RESULT_FOR]-> Assessment
Module -[:HAS_ASSESSMENT]-> Assessment
Scenes:

Module Schedule: Visualize the module's activities, their timeslots, and associated rooms. Highlight potential scheduling conflicts or overlaps.
Student Performance: Focus on a specific assessment and visualize student results. Identify students who may need additional support.
Room Suitability: Analyze the rooms used for the module's activities and their capacities. Identify potential issues with room size or suitability.
Cypher Queries:

Module Schedule:
Cypher
MATCH (m:Module {name: 'Calculus'})-[:HAS_ACTIVITY]->(a:Activity)-[:TAKES_PLACE_IN]->(r:Room)
RETURN m, a, r
Use code with caution.

Student Performance:
Cypher
MATCH (m:Module {name: 'Calculus'})-[:HAS_ASSESSMENT]->(as:Assessment)<-[:HAS_RESULT_FOR]-(s:Student)
RETURN m, as, s
Use code with caution.

Room Suitability:
Cypher
MATCH (m:Module {name: 'Calculus'})-[:HAS_ACTIVITY]->(a:Activity)-[:TAKES_PLACE_IN]->(r:Room)
RETURN m, a, r
Use code with caution.

Scenario 3: Administrator Perspective (Room Usage)

Goal: Empower an administrator to analyze room usage, identify underutilized spaces, and optimize room allocation.

Perspective:

Nodes:

Room (central node)
Activity
Module
Programme
Relationships:

Activity -[:TAKES_PLACE_IN]-> Room
Module -[:HAS_ACTIVITY]-> Activity
Programme -[:HAS_MODULE]-> Module
Scenes:

Room Utilization Overview: Visualize all rooms and their occupancy levels across different time periods. Highlight rooms with low utilization or frequent conflicts.
Room Activity Breakdown: Focus on a specific room and visualize the activities scheduled there. Identify peak usage times and potential scheduling issues.
Programme Room Usage: Analyze room usage by different programmes. Identify programmes with high room demands or potential conflicts.
Cypher Queries:

Room Utilization Overview:
Cypher
MATCH (r:Room)<-[:TAKES_PLACE_IN]-(a:Activity)
RETURN r, a
Use code with caution.

Room Activity Breakdown:
Cypher
MATCH (r:Room {name: 'Lecture Hall A'})<-[:TAKES_PLACE_IN]-(a:Activity)
RETURN r, a
Use code with caution.

Programme Room Usage:
Cypher
MATCH (p:Programme)-[:HAS_MODULE]->(m:Module)-[:HAS_ACTIVITY]->(a:Activity)-[:TAKES_PLACE_IN]->(r:Room)
RETURN p, m, a, r
Use code with caution.

Implementation Tips:

Start Simple: Begin with a basic perspective and scene, then gradually add more nodes, relationships, and queries as you explore the data.
Leverage Visualizations: Use Neo4j Bloom's visualization capabilities to create intuitive and interactive scenes.
Experiment with Filters: Apply filters to focus on specific aspects of the data and gain deeper insights.
Collaborate: Involve programme leads, module leads, and administrators in the design and development process to ensure the perspectives and scenes meet their needs.
