For the proof-of-concept, the following programmes and associated data (students, staff, modules, activities, rooms, etc.) were extracted from the source system and transformed before being loaded into a Neo4j cloud instance.

The table below summarises the time taken for each programme.

| pos | level | hostkey | count | extract & process | gdrive | neo4j |
|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Artificial Intelligence | PG | I400 | 16 | 26.8s | 26.1s | 2m 50.6s |
| Data Science | PG | INB112 | 206 | 57.6s | 26.5s | 1m 35.1s |
| Mathematics | UG | G90D | 103 | 38.8s | 25.5s | 6m 12.9s |
| Computer Science | UG | I10J | 431 | 1m 9.8s | 24.1s | 11m 16.1s |
| Computer Science | UG | G500 | 45 | 30s | 24.4s | 2m 9.5s |
| Cyber Security and Digital Forensics | UG | G4H4 | 271 | 57.4s | 51.9s | 6m 36.3s |
| Cyber Security | PG | I900 | 216 | 45.7s | 25.9s | 3m 7.5s |
| Information Management | PG | P110 | 42 | 17.2s | 25.8s | 1m 35.1s |
| Information Technology | PG | G56A12 | 174 | 28.3s | 25.8s | 2m 22.3s |

The largest programme (Computer Science) took just over 1 minute to extract and process and 11 minutes to load into Neo4j. The Google Load consistently took \~25 seconds regardless of file sizes.

However, the current graph model creates a **significant** amount of relationships between nodes:

| node/relationship | count |
|-------------------|-------|
| programme (n)     | 4     |
| department (n)    | 1     |
| hasOwningDept (r) | 4     |
