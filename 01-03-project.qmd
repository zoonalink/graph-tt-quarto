01-03 Aim and Scope of Project
Project Aim
The primary aim of this project is to [concise statement of your main goal, e.g., "investigate the viability of using graph data structures for enhanced timetabling analytics and reporting"].
Scope
This project will focus on:

[Specific aspect of timetabling you're addressing, e.g., "Developing a graph-based data model for university timetables"]
[Another key area of focus, e.g., "Implementing a prototype system for timetable analysis using graph databases"]
[Additional area, e.g., "Comparing the analytical capabilities of graph-based and traditional relational database approaches"]
Exploring the potential of graph-based approaches to address some of the key challenges in timetabling, such as curriculum complexity and data interoperability.

The project will not include:

[Aspect outside of scope, e.g., "Implementation of a full-scale timetabling system"]
[Another limitation, e.g., "Real-time timetable generation or optimization"]

Objectives
The key objectives of this project are:

[Specific objective, e.g., "Design an extensible, system-agnostic graph data model for university timetables"]
[Another objective, e.g., "Develop a mapping pipeline to transition from relational to graph database representations of timetables"]
[Further objective, e.g., "Implement and evaluate a set of analytical metrics leveraging the graph data model"]
[Final objective, e.g., "Compare the performance and capabilities of graph-based analytics against traditional relational database approaches"]
Investigate how graph-based approaches might contribute to measuring and improving timetable 'quality' from various stakeholder perspectives.

Through these objectives, we aim to explore the potential of graph-based approaches in enhancing our understanding and analysis of university timetables, potentially opening new avenues for timetable quality assessment and optimization. This work aligns with the growing recognition of timetabling as a critical factor in institutional sustainability, student satisfaction, and overall university operations.
