Timetables also influence resource utilisation and play a key role in institutional efficiency.  In short, timetables are critical to the individual experience and the overall success of an institution.  But timetables are also contentious - there is no 'perfect' timetable, only a series of compromises that balance competing priorities. \n\nThis project explores the use of graph data models to provide deeper insights into timetables.  The aim is to investigate the viability of graph-based approaches for enhanced timetabling analytics and reporting.  The objectives include designing a graph data model, developing a configurable ETL pipeline, and discussing how graph-based analysis could contribute to quantitaviely measuring timetable quality by introducing the concept of a *Timetable Quality Index*.  \n\nThe project is a proof-of-concept, and the results are intended to inform future research and development in the area of timetabling analytics.  The project is implemented primarily in Python, using the Neo4j cloud instance graph database, and the results and documentation are presented in a Quarto website.\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n**Supervisor**: [Xiaodong Li](https://people.uwe.ac.uk/Person/XiaodongLi)\n\n**Programme**: [MSc Data Science](https://courses.uwe.ac.uk/INB112/data-science)\n\n**Abstract**: \n\nTimetables are central to the daily experience of university students and staff.
