* Add agile reference

I followed an interative, agile-inspired approach when developing the data pipeline, despite being a team of one.  This allowed for flexibility, continuous improvement and the opportunity to adapt to new insights during the process.  The bulk of my effort was spent *prototyping*, *testing* and *reviewing* with each iteration resulting in a new challenge, issue, opportunity or occasionally, success.

### Initial Planning and Requirements Gathering

The development cycle began with initial high-level planning and requirements gathering, where I imagined how each stage should work, trying to bear in mind future-proofing and repeatability principles. 

I defined core functionality for each module (extraction, transformation, loading) and outlined initial technical requirements and constraints. The planning documentation was maintained in Quarto and markdown files in a centralised repository for project information. 

### Prototyping

Following the initial planning, rapid prototyping was undertaken for each module:

- SQL prototyping for data extraction queries
- Python prototyping for data transformation and processing logic
- Neo4j prototyping for graph database schema and loading procedures

This stage allowed for quick exploration of different approaches and early identification of potential challenges as well as giving me the confidence to continue with my exploration.

### Component-Based Development and Testing

Development proceeded with a focus on individual components:

- Each module (extraction, transformation, loading) was developed separately with a view to distinct "handovers"
- An iterative, component-based testing approach was employed
- While formal unit tests were not always created, each component was thoroughly tested for functionality

This approach allowed for continuous progress while maintaining a focus on component-level quality.  It was during this phase that I started expanding configuration, logging and error-handling options.

### Integration -> Review -> Demo -> Feedback -> Repeat

As components reached a (more) stable state, they were integrated and reviewed:

- Components were combined to form larger functional units
- Integrated functionality was occasionally demonstrated to subject matter experts (operational timetablers, timetable manager, data manager)
- Feedback was gathered on functionality, usability, and alignment with requirements

Insights gained from reviews, demonstrations and ongoing development were continuously fed back into the process.  New requirements or modifications were documented, for example updates to SQL SELECT statements and data model interpretations.

With each new piece of information or change, decisions were required and made - but not always the right ones.

### Version Validation and Documentation

At pivotal junctures, e.g., when a stable version was achieved:

- End-to-end validation of the entire pipeline was performed.
- Results were documented in notebooks, including opportunities for improvement.
- Any issues (or opportunities) identified were logged for the next iteration.

### Continuous Learning and Adaptation

Throughout the development process, learning and adaptation became central to the project's evolution. Each iteration brought new insights, often through trial and error and certainly through unintended consequences or unforeseen complications. Early challenges included the need to modularise components *before* they became unmanageable, resisting the temptation to make overly ambitious changes or indeed resisting the temptation to carry on when it would have been better to pause and shore up progress. With practice, I became better at recognising when refactoring was necessary. These experiences underscored the importance of incremental progress and consistent testing in maintaining project stability and direction.

This iterative journey was far from linear. There were many moments of frustration, periods of painstaking troubleshooting, and the constant urge to overdeliver, often exceeding the original proof-of-concept scope. Yet, with each stumble, the process itself became more refined, transforming into a powerful tool for identifying and resolving issues.

While the core MVP (minimum viable product) requirements remained relatively stable (I set them after all!), the iterative approach empowered me to seize opportunities for enhancement. Each chance to modularise, parameterise, or fine-tune sparked an almost compulsive drive for improvement, pushing the pipeline beyond its initial scope. 

This dedication to continuous refinement, while time-consuming, ultimately resulted in a robust, flexible solution that can adapt gracefully to unforeseen challenges and serve as the starting point for future opportunities.

However, this rigorous development process naturally led to a greater focus on data engineering rather than delving into the potential insights offered by Neo4j, simply due to the allocation of time and resources.

The iterative approach proved to be more than just a development methodology. It facilitated personal growth, enhanced technical skills, and improved project management capabilities.
