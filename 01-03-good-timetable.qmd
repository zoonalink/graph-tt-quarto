One of the most challenging aspects of university timetabling is defining what constitutes a "good" timetable. Despite best efforts, it is virtually impossible to deliver universal satisfaction from a university timetable. The quality of a timetable is inherently subjective and varies among stakeholders depending on their preferences and demands on their time.

Based on surveys across various institutions, students typically prioritise (Dowland, 2018; Norman, 2022):

-   A clash-free timetable
-   Early release of timetables
-   Clear and accurate information
-   Full-year timetable availability
-   Minimal changes after publication
-   Effective communication of any changes
-   Balanced distribution of classes

The above are easy-to-measure deliverables but they do not address what a 'good' timetable looks like; individual stakeholders often have conflicting priorities:

-   Students may prefer learning times that align with their personal commitments (e.g. part-time employment or travel)
-   Academic staff may prefer teaching times that align with their research or personal commitments.
-   Administrators might focus on efficient resource utilisation and institutional sustainability.
-   Organisational units may have specific needs for specialised rooms or equipment.

This divergence in preferences and the complex interplay of constraints make it challenging to define and achieve a universally "good" timetable (Lindahl et al., 2018). It is this complexity that sets the stage for this project.

## Consider these timetables:

-   The first timetable is evenly spread over five days. Tuesday afternoons are heavily scheduled; activities take place over lunch.
-   The second timetable has two days free of activities (Wednesday and Thursday). Monday has a single activity at 18:00-19:00.
-   The third timetable has activities on five days. There are large gaps between activities on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The answer is *it depends!* or *none of them!*
