Opportunities with Timetabling Data Combined with External Sources

Equitable Access and Outcomes Analysis:

Data: Combine timetable data with SES, POLAR, Free Lunch data, and graduate outcomes.
Insights: Identify if timetable structures disproportionately impact specific student groups. For instance, are students from disadvantaged backgrounds more likely to have early morning classes or clashes with part-time work commitments? Does this impact their academic performance or future prospects?
Action: Use insights to proactively address disparities in access and outcomes by adjusting timetables, providing targeted support, or informing policy changes.
Student Travel and Engagement:

Data: Include student term-time addresses and combine with attendance and engagement data.
Insights: Understand the impact of travel distances on student engagement and academic performance. Identify potential transport barriers for specific student groups or areas.
Action: Optimize timetable scheduling to minimize travel distances, particularly for students with long commutes. Explore targeted transportation solutions or support services.
Popular Module Combinations and Student Choice:

Data: Analyze student enrolment data within programmes and identify popular module combinations.
Insights: Understand student preferences and identify frequently chosen module combinations. This can inform program design, curriculum development, and elective module offerings.
Action: Adapt programme structures to align with student choices, and offer targeted module recommendations based on popular combinations and individual student interests.
Self-Serve Timetable Changes and Student Behavior:

Data: Analyze student self-serve timetable changes and compare original and modified schedules.
Insights: Gain insights into student preferences and identify common reasons for timetable modifications. This can inform timetable design and optimize scheduling processes.
Action: Address common issues identified through timetable adjustments, such as frequent clashes or gaps in scheduling. Optimize the self-serve process based on student behavior.
Facilities Optimization and Space Utilization:

Data: Integrate estates/facilities datasets with timetable and occupancy data.
Insights: Identify underutilized spaces and peak usage times. Optimize space allocation and improve campus resource management.
Action: Adjust timetables to balance space utilization, explore flexible learning environments, and inform future campus development plans.
Student Clustering and Community Building:

Data: Incorporate student demographic and interest data (with appropriate privacy safeguards)
Insights: Identify clusters of students with shared characteristics or interests. This can inform targeted support services, social events, and community-building initiatives.
Action: Foster a sense of belonging by connecting students with similar backgrounds or interests. Tailor support services to meet the needs of specific student groups.
Module and Timeslot Recommendations:

Data: Combine timetable, enrolment, student performance, and feedback data.
Insights: Develop a recommender system to suggest module combinations and timeslots based on student interests, past performance, and peer recommendations.
Action: Personalize the student experience and improve course selection. Offer tailored guidance and support to enhance academic success.
Unpopular Activity Analysis:

Data: Analyze attendance data and identify unpopular activities, correlating them with time, location, staff, and other properties.
Insights: Understand the factors contributing to low attendance and identify potential areas for improvement.
Action: Adjust timetable scheduling, explore alternative teaching approaches, or provide additional support to address identified issues.
Identifying Anomalies and Opportunities:

Data: Apply graph algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify patterns, anomalies, and trends in combined datasets.
Insights: Discover hidden opportunities for improvement, detect potential issues proactively, and gain deeper insights into complex relationships between various factors.
Action: Address identified issues, optimize processes, and leverage opportunities for innovation and continuous improvement.
Important Considerations and Questions for Further Clarification:

Data Privacy and Ethics: Ensure compliance with all relevant data protection regulations and obtain necessary consent for data usage. Anonymize or pseudonymize sensitive data.
Data Quality and Integration: Address potential challenges with data quality, consistency, and integration across disparate sources.
Scalability and Performance: Consider the scalability and performance implications of graph databases as the volume of data grows.
User Interface and Visualization: Develop user-friendly interfaces and visualizations to enable easy exploration and understanding of insights.
